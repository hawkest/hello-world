# hello-world
Just my First Repository

Just starting out with github heard good things about it and never really thought I'd need to use it. I see the potential and looking forward to the collaboration it can bring.

I'm an up and coming electronics design engineer who is trying to find his niche but has a couple of mini projects and need somewhere to control all the work.
